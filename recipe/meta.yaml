  summary: Facebook Open-source Library
  description: |
    Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a
    library of C++14 components designed with practicality and
    efficiency in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library
    components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often
    a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place
    where those projects can share code.
